# Project Remake: University Game

Welcome to the remake of my classic university project.

## About

This project is an exciting remake of a university assignment, now turned into a playable game. It's an opportunity to revisit the past and bring new life to an old project. We've focused on refining the code structure to make it more maintainable and scalable. Developed using Vite, a fast and modern build tool.

To experience the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
